# Prime Agent fork patches

Upstream baseline: `9ba3bcd10b9e92be0b299d8721f1393b92e911a0` (Superpowers 6.2.0).

The fork keeps every non-allowlisted upstream byte exact. The semantic changes are:

- `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md`: keeps brainstorming read-only by default, skips standalone artifacts for small changes, and keeps design prose free of implementation code blocks.
- `skills/brainstorming/spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md`: assigns read-only spec review to host-assigned Luna capacity without granting approval or write authority.
- `skills/brainstorming/visual-companion.md`: routes screen/state and repository-metadata writes through explicit host grants.
- `skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md`: makes parallel dispatch methodology-only; the host assigns named Luna capacity and owns write, stage, commit, push, approval, merge, and completion authority.
- `skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md`: routes each task through public intent RED/GREEN, durable regressions, real-boundary evidence, host-pinned worktrees, and independent review without granting write, stage, commit, or push authority.
- `skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md`: turns branch finishing into an evidence and integration recommendation for immutable candidate/integration SHAs; the host retains write, stage, commit, push, mutation, and completion authority.
- `skills/receiving-code-review/SKILL.md`: keeps review-driven fixes at the public intent boundary; permits unit probes only temporarily for debugging and treats mocks, counts, and coverage as supplemental diagnostics under named-Luna host authority with no write, stage, commit, or push access.
- `skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md`: requires canonical caller-supplied full base, candidate, and integration SHAs, validates that integration is an ancestor of base and both reach candidate, binds the receipt, and uses host-assigned Luna capacity without write, stage, commit, or push authority.
- `skills/requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md`: makes review read-only, rejects moving refs and sibling integration histories, verifies exact ancestry, and removes worktree creation and coverage/count completion claims; unit probes are temporary debugging aids only.
- `skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md`: uses role-based dispatch with host-assigned Luna capacity and exact review-package SHA inputs while keeping writes, approval, merge, and completion outside the skill.
- `skills/subagent-driven-development/implementer-prompt.md`: requires public intent acceptance, observed RED, durable adversarial regressions, real-boundary evidence, host-assigned Luna capacity, and temporary debugging-only unit probes.
- `skills/subagent-driven-development/re-review-prompt.md`: binds re-review evidence to public acceptance, immutable candidate/integration inputs, host-assigned Luna read-only capacity, and temporary debugging-only unit probes.
- `skills/subagent-driven-development/scripts/review-package`: requires canonical full base/candidate/integration SHAs, verifies integration is an ancestor of base and both base and integration reach candidate, and writes an exact-SHA review receipt.
- `skills/subagent-driven-development/task-reviewer-prompt.md`: makes public intent evidence and anti-cheating review mandatory; unit probes are temporary debugging aids, unit or mock-only checks cannot promote work, and review capacity is host-assigned Luna.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/CREATION-LOG.md`: records public-boundary intent regressions and real evidence; unit probes are temporary debugging aids, and mocks, counts, and coverage cannot promote completion.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/condition-based-waiting-example.ts`: labels historical timing-test metrics as diagnostics and keeps public-boundary intent evidence authoritative.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/condition-based-waiting.md`: keeps condition-waiting helpers as temporary debugging probes and rejects count, pass-rate, coverage, or mock-only completion evidence.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md`: limits unit probes to temporary diagnosis and requires public-boundary regressions plus real durability or authority evidence.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/defense-in-depth.md`: requires public-boundary evidence and rejects mock, count, or coverage-only completion claims.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/find-polluter.sh`: delegates the acceptance runner to a host-supplied command and reports pollution without test-count completion claims.
- `skills/systematic-debugging/root-cause-tracing.md`: preserves root-cause failures as durable public intent regressions and removes raw runner/count evidence.
- `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`: centers TDD on user intent, forbidden outcomes, public-boundary RED, adversarial regressions, real evidence, anti-cheating, and independent review; unit tests are permitted only as temporary debugging probes.
- `skills/test-driven-development/writing-good-tests.md`: makes public-boundary intent tests durable and permits unit probes only temporarily for debugging while treating mocks, counts, and coverage as supplemental diagnostics.
- `skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md`: pins substantial work to a caller-supplied canonical full integration SHA, executes an exact-HEAD guard for existing/native/fallback workspaces, keeps small edits coordinator-owned, forbids inferred merge bases and in-place fallbacks, requires an explicit host write grant, stops before creation when the repository has no commits, and warns per declared input path that the new workspace lacks because it is untracked or ignored without ever copying one into place.
- `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`: routes implementation workflows through public-boundary TDD and review gates while leaving capacity and authority to the host.
- `skills/using-superpowers/references/antigravity-tools.md`: makes host ownership of writes, approvals, merges, completion, and Luna capacity explicit.
- `skills/using-superpowers/references/codex-tools.md`: requires the pinned runtime for host-assigned Luna capacity and removes agent-side stage/commit/merge authority.
- `skills/using-superpowers/references/gemini-tools.md`: routes tool mutation and Luna capacity assignment through the host instead of generic agent labels.
- `skills/using-superpowers/references/pi-tools.md`: routes subagent capacity and all mutation authority through the host.
- `skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md`: requires fresh public intent evidence and adversarial verification without granting completion authority or using counts as evidence.
- `skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`: emits concise task graphs, constraints, and acceptance scenarios without implementation pseudo-code or unit-only GREEN claims.
- `skills/writing-plans/plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md`: assigns read-only plan review to host-assigned Luna capacity without granting approval or write authority.
- `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md`: delegates deployment mutation and integration decisions to the host, and makes public-process intent scenarios authoritative over diagnostic counts or coverage.
- `skills/writing-skills/anthropic-best-practices.md`: replaces non-Luna model-tier guidance with host-assigned Luna capacity and stable public-boundary evaluation.
- `skills/writing-skills/examples/CLAUDE_MD_TESTING.md`: keeps integration choices with the host rather than directing agent commits.
- `skills/writing-skills/graphviz-conventions.dot`: replaces raw build/commit actions with host acceptance and integration placeholders.
- `skills/writing-skills/testing-skills-with-subagents.md`: makes skill pressure checks scenario-level behavioral fixtures and permits unit probes only temporarily for debugging; mock, count, and coverage output remains supplemental.

## Provenance reconciliation

`SOURCE.json` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE.md` bind this package to upstream
Superpowers 6.2.0 at `9ba3bcd10b9e92be0b299d8721f1393b92e911a0`, superseding the
stale design-spec reference `b6b58974aa8c731d7c160975959a0e62777975c6`. The
exact upstream `LICENSE` remains authoritative and is retained unchanged.
